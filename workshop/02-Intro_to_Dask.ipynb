    "Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that makes scaling out your workflow smooth and simple. On the CPU, Dask uses Pandas (NumPy) to execute operations in parallel on DataFrame (array) partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask-cuDF extends Dask where necessary to allow its DataFrame partitions to be processed by cuDF GPU DataFrames as opposed to Pandas DataFrames. For instance, when you call dask_cudf.read_csv(…), your cluster’s GPUs do the work of parsing the CSV file(s) with underlying cudf.read_csv(). Dask also supports array based workflows using CuPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Dask\n",
    "If your workflow is fast enough on a single GPU or your data comfortably fits in memory on a single GPU, you would want to use cuDF or CuPy. If you want to distribute your workflow across multiple GPUs, have more data than you can fit in memory on a single GPU, or want to analyze data spread across many files at once, you would want to use Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional benefit Dask provides is that it lets us easily spill data between device and host memory. This can be very useful when we need to do work that would otherwise cause out of memory errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this brief notebook, you'll walk through an example of using Dask on a single GPU. Because we're using Dask, the same code in this notebook would work on two, eight, 16, or 100s of GPUs."

    "# Creating a Local Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to scale workflows on a single node is to use the `LocalCUDACluster` API. This lets us create a GPU cluster, using one worker per GPU by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll pass the following arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, to limit our cluster to a single GPU (for demonstration purposes).\n",
    "- `device_memory_limit`, to illustrate how we can spill data between GPU and CPU memory. Artificial memory limits like this reduce our performance if we don't actually need them, but can let us accomplish much larger tasks when we do.\n",
    "- `rmm_pool_size`, to use the RAPIDS Memory Manager to allocate one big chunk of memory upfront rather than having our operations call `cudaMalloc` all the time under the hood. This improves performance, and is generally a best practice."

As a result, you'll usually need to call an **eager** operation like `len` or `persist` to actually trigger work.\n",

When we spin up a cluster, we're interacting with our cluster in what we call the `Client` Python process. When we created a `Client` object above, this is what we did. Calling `compute` brings all of the results back to a single GPU cuDF DataFrame in the client process, not in any of the worker processes. This means we're not using the same memory pool, so we could go out of memory if we're not careful.\n",
